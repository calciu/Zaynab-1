*Price and Pharmaceutical Marketing**

The price of pharmaceutical products plays a vital role in promoting

drugs to doctors. Pharmaceutical prices are heavily regulated with price

fluctuations rare and small but there are various factors can increase

the price of medicines in the United States;

-   Patents and Market exclusivity prevent regular price competition

-   The existence of multiple insurers breaks down the power of buyer to

    negotiate price

-   The absence of a national health technology assessment system that

    limits the ability to set prices. \[1\]

**How do doctors and patients react with expensive drugs?**

According to publication "Modeling the effects of pharmaceutical

marketing", physicians work in the interest of patients and do not have

a financial stimulus to be price sensitive \[5\]. Physicians' price

sensitivity comes second to considerations about drug efficacy and

patients' conditions. \[11\]

Insured patients are likely not price sensitive and have little

awareness of the retail price of their prescription. \[5\]

**Effect of marketing expenses on price sensitivity**

Hurwitz and Caves (1988), Rizzo (1999), and Windmeijer et al. (2005)

find that marketing expenses reduce price sensitivity and conclude that

marketing expenses have a mainly convincing effect but for Leffler

(1981) marketing efforts can increase price sensitivity. The results of

the study "Modeling the effects of pharmaceutical marketing" show that

the demand for the large majority of the brands is not affected by the

price and there is no evidence that marketing expenses reduce price

sensitivity.

**Peak sales and pharmaceutical marketing**

Marketing expenses increase the level of peak sales, while reducing time

to peak sales. In the first two years after the launch of the drug,

pharmaceutical companies focus their marketing efforts that lead to high

sales but slow sales growth in subsequent years when marketing efforts

are limited.

Windemeijer et al. (2006) also find that promotion primarily expands

market share, while Rizzo (1999) finds evidence that promotion expands

the size of the market.
